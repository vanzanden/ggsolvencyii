determined based on specification of EIOPA standard formula Solvency II structure

\usage{
sii_z_ex2_outline
}
\description{
A table for \code{\link{geom_siiscroutline}} indicating which outlines of each item should be shown, specified per level and/or description. the latter overrule the former. \cr
when defining an item (or the \code{squared = TRUE} transformation) 4 lines can be distinguised, a radialline going outwards, a circle segment (clockwise), a radialline going inwards, a circle segment (counterclockwise). These are numbered as outline1 to outline4.
}
\details{
for testing of siiscrbuildup a outline where all fields are TRUE might be helpfull.
