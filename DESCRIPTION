Description: An implementation of ggplot2 to show the composition of (Solvency II) SCR as a diversificated
  sum of diversificated components, presented as a series of concentric circles or squares. 
  A ready made set of Standard Formula structure files is present, but insurers with internal models can adapt these files.
  options are available for combining smaller components, horizontal and vertical scaling, rotation (fixed and/or based on a component) 
  With outlines and connectors several SCR-plots can be compared, for example in ORSA scenarios.
